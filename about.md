Lawrence Barriner II, here. 

I believe in the power of love to create justice and the power of story to make new worlds possible. I [imagine radical alternatives](https://unleashingalternativefutures.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} to our existing reality not as an escape but as a strategy. I dream of a world where liberation is experienced, not just imagined. My work in building that world is to support transformation at all scales. 

At the scale of the individual, I support transformation through 1on1 **coaching**. At the organizational scale, I **facilitate** as a means to support groups of people to move through or transform in relationship to barriers. At the network scale, I support ecosystem transformation by supporting people to **think** about what it means to move like a network and then **act** accordingly. 

I have a Master of City Planning and Bachelor of Science in Planning, both from MIT's Department of Urban Studies and Planning. My research while at MIT primarily focused on food systems and food justice. Teaching (and doing) photography scratched my creative itches. 

My paid work is primarily **network weaving, facilitation and coaching, narrative strategy,** and **storytelling**. I do these as a staff person, as a consultant, and sometimes both. 

I am Black, queer, feminist, and always learning. I was born in Atlanta, Georgia, grew up in Tallahassee, Florida, and have lived in Boston since the Fall of 2007 (save two gap years in the middle of undergrad when I almost became a monk). I run [a consulting practice](http://lqb2.co/), a [blog](http://lqb2.co/blog/), a weekly(ish) [newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/lqb2), a [radio show about patriarchy](https://postpatriarchalradio.tumblr.com/), and two podcasts (one is [about life](https://www.liferadiopodcast.com/) and the other is about [the enneagram](https://intersectionalenneagram.tumblr.com/). I also run a [post-patriarchy time travel project](https://infinitegrowth.rocks/vision/post-patriarchy-futures/). 

My vision of the world has people living in right relationship with each other, the planet, and all beings (human and non). I am a proud gay uncle to the children of several friends and know Iâ€™m moving at the right pace when I am baking sourdough at least once a week.
